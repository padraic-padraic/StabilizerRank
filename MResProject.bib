abstract = {We present a method for estimating the probabilities of outcomes of a quantum circuit using Monte Carlo sampling techniques applied to a quasiprobability representation. Our estimate converges to the true quantum probability at a rate determined by the total negativity in the circuit, using a measure of negativity based on the 1-norm of the quasiprobability. If the negativity grows at most polynomially in the size of the circuit, our estimator converges efficiently. These results highlight the role of negativity as a measure of non-classical resources in quantum computation.},

abstract = {We investigate stabilizer codes with carrier qudits of equal dimension {\$}D{\$}, an arbitrary integer greater than 1. We prove that there is a direct relation between the dimension of a qudit stabilizer code and the size of its corresponding stabilizer, and this implies that the code and its stabilizer are dual to each other. We also show that any qudit stabilizer can be put in a standard, or canonical, form using a series of Clifford gates, and we provide an explicit efficient algorithm for doing this. Our work generalizes known results that were valid only for prime dimensional systems and may be useful in constructing efficient encoding/decoding quantum circuits for qudit stabilizer codes and better qudit quantum error correcting codes.},

@article{Bennett1997,
abstract = {Recently a great deal of attention has focused on quantum computation following a sequence of results suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time {\$}o(2{\^{}}{\{}n/2{\}}){\$}. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class {\$}NP \backslashcap coNP{\$} cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time {\$}o(2{\^{}}{\{}n/3{\}}){\$}. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time {\$}O(2{\^{}}{\{}n/2{\}}){\$}.},

abstract = {We consider a model of quantum computation in which the set of elementary operations is limited to Clifford unitaries, the creation of the state {\$}|0{\textgreater}{\$}, and qubit measurement in the computational basis. In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state {\$}\backslashrho{\$}, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which {\$}\backslashrho{\$} universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ``magic'' directions. If the polarization of {\$}\backslashrho{\$} along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65{\%}), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

Contrary to previous methods, which usually solve this problem by minimizing the L1 norm using Linear Programming (LP) techniques, our algorithm tries to directly minimize the L0 norm. It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is about two to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art interior-point LP solvers, while providing the same (or better) accuracy.},

abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that requires at most O(n{\^{}}2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

abstract = {"In this Letter we present a more general proof based on the structure of the Lie group of transversal unitary operators. Our result applies to all local-error-detecting quantum codes, that is, all quantum codes capable of detecting an arbitrary error on any single subsystem. An outline of the argument is as follows: The set of logical unitary product operators, G, is a Lie subgroup of the Lie group of unitary product operators, T. As a Lie group, G can be partitioned into cosets of the connected component of the identity, C; these cosets form a discrete set, Q. Using the fact that the Lie algebra of C is a subalgebra of T, it can be shown that the connected component of the identity acts trivially for any local- error-detecting code. This implies that the number of logi- cally distinct operators implemented by elements of G is limited to the cardinality of Q. Because of the compact- ness of T, this number must be finite. A finite number of operators can approximate infinitely many only up to some fixed accuracy; thus, G, the set of logical unitary product operators, cannot be universal. Transversal operators may be viewed as product operators with respect to a transversal partitioning of the code, so the ability to detect an arbitrary error on a transversal part implies the nonexistence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set."},

abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that a quantum circuit composed of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits. Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.5 t{\}} t{\^{}}3{\$} and {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.23 t{\}} t{\^{}}3 w{\^{}}4{\$} respectively, where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear combination of {\$}\backslashchi{\$} stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time {\$}\backslashchi n{\^{}}3 \backslashepsilon{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is the relative error. We also develop techniques for approximating tensor products of "magic states" by linear combinations of stabilizer states.

The field of quantum error correction has developed to meet this challenge. A group-theoretical structure and associated subclass of quantum codes, the stabilizer codes, has proved particularly fruitful in producing codes and in understanding the structure of both specific codes and classes of codes. I will give an overview of the field of quantum error correction and the formalism of stabilizer codes. In the context of stabilizer codes, I will discuss a number of known codes, the capacity of a quantum channel, bounds on quantum codes, and fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

The contribution of this paper is a reduction of the LU-LC conjecture to a simpler problem - which, however, remains to date unsolved. As our main result, we show that, if the LU-LC conjecture could be proved for the restricted case of diagonal local unitary operations, then the conjecture is correct in its totality. Furthermore, the reduced version of the problem, involving such diagonal local operations, is mapped to questions regarding quadratic forms over the finite field GF(2). Finally, we prove that correctness of the LU-LC conjecture for stabilizer states implies a similar result for the more general case of stabilizer codes.},

In addition, the most well-understood quantum error correcting codes—stabilizer codes—are built using Pauli operators. The eigenstates of these operators—stabilizer states—display a structure (e.g., mutual orthogonality relationships) that has made them useful in examples of multi-qubit non-locality and contextuality. Here, we apply the graph-theoretical contextuality formalism of Cabello, Severini and Winter to sets of stabilizer states, with particular attention to the effect of generalizing two-level qubit systems to odd prime d-level qudit systems. While state-independent contextuality using two-qubit states does not generalize to qudits, we show explicitly how state-dependent contextuality associated with a Bell inequality does generalize. Along the way we note various structural properties of stabilizer states, with respect to their orthogonality relationships, which may be of independent interest.},

It is shown that any sparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Secondly, we study Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are non-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The computation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state. This model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show that any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Finally, we propose a purely classical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}c n{\}} poly(n){\$} where {\$}c\backslashapprox 0.94{\$}. This improves upon the brute-force simulation method which takes time {\$}2{\^{}}n poly(n){\$}.

abstract = {Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the source of the power in quantum computing has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via 'magic state' distillation, which is the leading model for experimentally realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This is a conceptually satisfying link, because contextuality, which precludes a simple 'hidden variable' model of quantum mechanics, provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the non-locality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality, and non-locality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation, and putting bounds on the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.},

The normal form highlights why Clifford circuits have such limited computational power in spite of their high entangling power. At the same time, the normal form shows how the classical simulation of Clifford circuits fits into the standard way of embedding classical computation into the quantum circuit model. This leads to simple extensions of Clifford circuits which are classically simulatable. These circuits can be efficiently simulated by classical sampling ('weak simulation') even though the problem of exactly computing the outcomes of measurements for these circuits ('strong simulation') is proved to be {\#}P-complete--thus showing that there is a separation between weak and strong classical simulation of quantum computation.},

In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of a sparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, where sparse representation is sought to recover human identities from very high-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facial disguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is a linear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability for large-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classical convex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). The new convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-critical applications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to validate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against several popular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy, FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS.

abstract = {Communication complexity has become a central complexity model. In that model, we count the amount of communication bits needed between two parties in order to solve certain computational problems. We show that for certain communication complexity problems quantum communication protocols are exponentially faster than classical ones. More explicitly, we give an example for a communication complexity relation (or promise problem) P such that: 1) The quantum communication complexity of P is O(log m). 2) The classical probabilistic communication complexity of P is Omega(m{\^{}}(1/4) / log m). (where m is the length of the inputs). This gives an exponential gap between quantum communication complexity and classical probabilistic communication complexity. Only a quadratic gap was previously known. Our problem P is of geometrical nature, and is a finite precision variation of the following problem: Player I gets as input a unit vector x $\backslash$in R{\^{}}n and two orthogonal subspaces M{\_}0, M{\_}1 $\backslash$subset R{\^{}}n. Player II gets as input an orthogonal matrix T : R{\^{}}n + R{\^{}}n. Their goal is to answer 0 if T(x) $\backslash$in M{\_}0 and 1 if T(x) $\backslash$in M{\_}1, (and any an{\~{}}luer in any other case). We give an almost tight analysis for the quantum communication complexity and for the classical-probabilistic communication complexity of this problem.},

abstract = {We present a classical protocol to efficiently simulate any pure-state quantum computation that involves only a restricted amount of entanglement. More generally, we show how to classically simulate pure-state quantum computations on n qubits by using computational resources that grow linearly in n and exponentially in the amount of entanglement in the quantum computer. Our results imply that a necessary condition for an exponential computational speedup (with respect to classical computations) is that the amount of entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and provide an explicit lower bound on the required growth.},

abstract = {We exhibit an orthogonal set of product states of two three-state particles that nevertheless cannot be reliably distinguished by a pair of separated observers ignorant of which of the states has been presented to them, even if the observers are allowed any sequence of local operations and classical communication between the separate observers. It is proved that there is a finite gap between the mutual information obtainable by a joint measurement on these states and a measurement in which only local actions are permitted. This result implies the existence of separable superoperators that cannot be implemented locally. A set of states are found involving three two-state particles which also appear to be nonmeasurable locally. These and other multipartite states are classified according to the entropy and entanglement costs of preparing and measuring them by local operations.},

abstract = {We give a constructive proof that all mixed states of N qubits in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the maximally mixed state are separable (unentangled). The construction provides an explicit representation of any such state as a mixture of product states. We give upper and lower bounds on the size of the neighborhood, which show that its extent decreases exponentially with the number of qubits. The bounds show that no entanglement appears in the physical states at any stage of present NMR experiments. Though this result raises questions about NMR quantum computation, further analysis would be necessary to assess the power of the general unitary transformations, which are indeed implemented in these experiments, in their action on separable states.},

abstract = {Since Shor's discovery of an algorithm to factor numbers on a quantum computer in polynomial time, quantum computation has become a subject of immense interest. Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

In order to find someone's phone number with a 50{\%} probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

@article{Deutsch1985,
abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

@article{Garcia2012,
abstract = {Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n{\^{}}2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n{\^{}}3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly 4(2{\^{}}n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms to compute the inner product between two such frames.},
