abstract = {Attempts to separate the power of classical and quantum models of computation have a long history. The ultimate goal is to find exponential separations for computational problems. However, such separations do not come a dime a dozen: while there were some early successes in the form of hidden subgroup problems for abelian groups--which generalize Shor's factoring algorithm perhaps most faithfully--only for a handful of non-abelian groups efficient quantum algorithms were found. Recently, problems have gotten increased attention that seek to identify hidden sub-structures of other combinatorial and algebraic objects besides groups. In this paper we provide new examples for exponential separations by considering hidden shift problems that are defined for several classes of highly non-linear Boolean functions. These so-called bent functions arise in cryptography, where their property of having perfectly flat Fourier spectra on the Boolean hypercube gives them resilience against certain types of attack. We present new quantum algorithms that solve the hidden shift problems for several well-known classes of bent functions in polynomial time and with a constant number of queries, while the classical query complexity is shown to be exponential. Our approach uses a technique that exploits the duality between bent functions and their Fourier transforms.},

@article{Bravyi2016,
abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that a quantum circuit composed of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits. Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.5 t{\}} t{\^{}}3{\$} and {\$}poly(n,m)+2{\^{}}{\{}0.23 t{\}} t{\^{}}3 w{\^{}}4{\$} respectively, where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear combination of {\$}\backslashchi{\$} stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time {\$}\backslashchi n{\^{}}3 \backslashepsilon{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is the relative error. We also develop techniques for approximating tensor products of "magic states" by linear combinations of stabilizer states. To demonstrate the power of the new simulation methods, we performed a classical simulation of a hidden shift quantum algorithm with 40 qubits, a few hundred Clifford gates, and nearly 50 T-gates.},

abstract = {Two-level quantum systems, qubits, are not the only basis for quantum computation. Advantages exist in using qudits, d-level quantum systems, as the basic carrier of quantum information. We show that color codes, a class of topological quantum codes with remarkable transversality properties, can be generalized to the qudit paradigm. In recent developments it was found that in three spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal non-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional non-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 170503 (2013)]. Furthermore, by using gauge fixing techniques, an effective set of Clifford gates can be achieved, removing the need for state distillation. We show that the qudit color code can support the qudit analogues of these gates, and show that in higher spatial dimensions a color code can support a phase gate from higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy which can be proven to saturate Bravyi and K$\backslash$"onig's bound in all but a finite number of special cases. The methodology used is a generalisation of Bravyi and Haah's method of triorthogonal matrices [Phys. Rev. A 86 052329 (2012)], which may be of independent interest. For completeness, we show explicitly that the qudit color codes generalize to gauge color codes, and share the many of the favorable properties of their qubit counterparts.},

abstract = {{\$}\backslashtextit{\{}Normalizer circuits{\}}{\$} [1,2] are generalized Clifford circuits that act on arbitrary finite-dimensional systems {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}1{\}}\backslashotimes ... \backslashotimes \backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}n{\}}{\$} with a standard basis labeled by the elements of a finite Abelian group {\$}G=\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}1{\}}\backslashtimes... \backslashtimes \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}n{\}}{\$}. Normalizer gates implement operations associated with the group {\$}G{\$} and can be of three types: quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism gates and quadratic phase gates. In this work, we extend the normalizer formalism [1,2] to infinite dimensions, by allowing normalizer gates to act on systems of the form {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashotimes a{\}}{\$}: each factor {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}H{\}}{\_}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$} has a standard basis labeled by {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}integers{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\$}, and a Fourier basis labeled by {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}angles{\}}{\$}, elements of the circle group {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}T{\}}{\$}. Normalizer circuits become hybrid quantum circuits acting both on continuous- and discrete-variable systems. We show that infinite-dimensional normalizer circuits can be efficiently simulated classically with a generalized {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}stabilizer formalism{\}}{\$} for Hilbert spaces associated with groups of the form {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\^{}}a\backslashtimes \backslashmathbb{\{}T{\}}{\^{}}b \backslashtimes \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}1{\}}\backslashtimes...\backslashtimes \backslashmathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}{\{}d{\_}n{\}}{\$}. We develop new techniques to track stabilizer-groups based on normal forms for group automorphisms and quadratic functions. We use our normal forms to reduce the problem of simulating normalizer circuits to that of finding general solutions of systems of mixed real-integer linear equations [3] and exploit this fact to devise a robust simulation algorithm: the latter remains efficient even in pathological cases where stabilizer groups become infinite, uncountable and non-compact. The techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4,5].},

This causes the cost of the synthesis to depend more strongly on the relative (rather than absolute) precision required. We analyze the mean and variance of the T-count required to use our techniques and show that, with high probability, the required T-count will be lower than lower bounds for the T-count required to do ancilla--free circuit synthesis. We also discuss the T-depth of our method and show that the vast majority of the cost of the resultant circuits can be shifted offline.},

The magic states are pure non-stabilizer states which can be distilled from certain mixed non-stabilizer states via Clifford group operations alone. Because of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, mixtures of Pauli eigenstates are not expected to be magic state distillable, but it has been an open question whether all mixed states outside this set may be distilled. In this Letter we show that, when resources are finitely limited, non-distillable states exist outside the stabilizer octahedron. In analogy with the bound entangled states, which arise in entanglement theory, we call such states bound states for magic state distillation.},

abstract = {Quantum circuit synthesis is the process in which an arbitrary unitary operation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set, typically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and fault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the need is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the circuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact, multi-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and circuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a handful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may lead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the size of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized physically as a result of having more efficient circuits. We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks. Also termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point is chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct a parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version performing optimal {\$}T{\$}-count synthesis over the Clifford+{\$}T{\$} gate set. We use our software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant speedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full adder has optimal {\$}T{\$}-count 7 and {\$}T{\$}-depth 3.},

Information theoretic arguments show that approximating a random unitary with precision $\epsilon$ requires $\Omega$(log(1/$\epsilon$)) gates. Prior to our work, the state of the art in approximating a single qubit unitary included the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm that requires O(log(3+$\delta$)(1/$\epsilon$)) gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)loglog(1/$\epsilon$)) gates but uses O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)) ancillae. Both algorithms feature upper bounds that are far from the information theoretic lower bound. In this Letter, we report an algorithm that saturates the lower bound, and as such it guarantees asymptotic optimality. In particular, we present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit unitaries with precision $\epsilon$ using O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) Clifford and T gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits. We connect the unitary approximation problem to the problem of constructing solutions corresponding to Lagrange's four-square theorem, and thereby develop an algorithm for computing an approximating circuit using an average of O(log(2)(1/$\epsilon$)loglog(1/$\epsilon$)) operations with integers.},

Given an n-qubit unitary U we are interested in computing a circuit that implements it using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to decide if the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem as a function of N=2{\^{}}n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which solves it using time and space both upper bounded as O(N{\^{}}m poly(m,N)). We implemented our algorithm and used it to show that any Clifford+T circuit for the Toffoli or the Fredkin gate requires at least 7 T gates. This implies that the known 7 T gate circuits for these gates are T-optimal. We also provide a simple expression for the T-count of single-qubit unitaries.},

abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that requires at most O(n{\^{}}2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

abstract = {The hidden shift problem is a natural place to look for new separations between classical and quantum models of computation. One advantage of this problem is its flexibility, since it can be defined for a whole range of functions and a whole range of underlying groups. In a way, this distinguishes it from the hidden subgroup problem where more stringent requirements about the existence of a periodic subgroup have to be made. And yet, the hidden shift problem proves to be rich enough to capture interesting features of problems of algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial flavor. We present a quantum algorithm to identify the hidden shift for any Boolean function. Using Fourier analysis for Boolean functions we relate the time and query complexity of the algorithm to an intrinsic property of the function, namely its minimum influence. We show that for randomly chosen functions the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. Based on this we show an average case exponential separation between classical and quantum time complexity. A perhaps interesting aspect of this work is that, while the extremal case of the Boolean hidden shift problem over so-called bent functions can be reduced to a hidden subgroup problem over an abelian group, the more general case studied here does not seem to allow such a reduction.},

First we consider sparse quantum circuits such that each qubit participates in O(1) two-qubit gates. It is shown that any sparse circuit on n+k qubits can be simulated by sparse circuits on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Secondly, we study Pauli-based computation (PBC) where allowed operations are non-destructive eigenvalue measurements of n-qubit Pauli operators. The computation begins by initializing each qubit in the so-called magic state. This model is known to be equivalent to the universal quantum computer. We show that any PBC on n+k qubits can be simulated by PBCs on n qubits and a classical processing that takes time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}O(k){\}} poly(n){\$}. Finally, we propose a purely classical algorithm that can simulate a PBC on n qubits in a time {\$}2{\^{}}{\{}c n{\}} poly(n){\$} where {\$}c\backslashapprox 0.94{\$}. This improves upon the brute-force simulation method which takes time {\$}2{\^{}}n poly(n){\$}.

abstract = {We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of universal fault tolerant computing on ternary quantum systems: (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control and (ii) a model based on a metaplectic topological quantum computer (MTQC). Arguably, a natural choice to implement Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to simply emulate the standard binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three level system. In this paper we address this emulation approach and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's period finding function in both models, (i) and (ii).We compare the costs in terms of magic state counts required in each mode and find that a binary emulation implementation of Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer requires slightly smaller circuit depth than the corresponding implementation in the binary Clifford{\$}+T{\$} framework. The reason for this are simplifications for binary arithmetic that can be leveraged over ternary gate sets. We also highlight that magic state preparation on MTQC requires magic state preprocessor of asymptotically smaller size which gives the MTQC solution a significant advantage over the binary framework.},

To this end, an extended version of the Jacobi approach for calculating the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in linear algebra is considered as the basis of the proposed synthesis method. The quantum circuit synthesis method derived from the Jacobi approach and its optimization challenges are described. It is shown that the proposed method results in multiple-control rotation gates around the y axis, multiple-control phase shift gates, multiple-control NOT gates and a middle diagonal Hermitian matrix, which can be synthesized to multiple-control Pauli Z gates. Using the proposed approach, it is shown how multiple-control U gates, where U is a single-qubit Hermitian quantum gate, can be implemented using a linear number of elementary gates in terms of circuit lines with the aid of one auxiliary qubit in an arbitrary state.},

In this Letter we focus on topological stabilizer codes and encoded unitary gates that can be implemented by a constant-depth quantum circuit. Such gates have a certain degree of protection since propagation of errors in a constant-depth circuit is limited by a constant size light cone. For the 2D geometry we show that constant-depth circuits can only implement a finite group of encoded gates known as the Clifford group. This implies that topological protection must be "turned off" for at least some steps in the computation in order to achieve universality. For the 3D geometry we show that an encoded gate U is implementable by a constant-depth circuit only if UPU(†) is in the Clifford group for any Pauli operator P. This class of gates includes some non-Clifford gates such as the $\pi$/8 rotation. Our classification applies to any stabilizer code with geometrically local stabilizers and sufficiently large code distance.},

We show how each Clifford circuit can be reduced to an equivalent, manifestly simulatable circuit (normal form). This provides a simple proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem without resorting to stabilizer techniques. The normal form highlights why Clifford circuits have such limited computational power in spite of their high entangling power. At the same time, the normal form shows how the classical simulation of Clifford circuits fits into the standard way of embedding classical computation into the quantum circuit model. This leads to simple extensions of Clifford circuits which are classically simulatable. These circuits can be efficiently simulated by classical sampling ('weak simulation') even though the problem of exactly computing the outcomes of measurements for these circuits ('strong simulation') is proved to be {\#}P-complete--thus showing that there is a separation between weak and strong classical simulation of quantum computation.},
