The potential for exponential speedups from quantum computing has been known since the earliest days of quantum computing~\cite{Jozsa2003}. In particular, in his 1985 paper David Deutsch....

The exact nature of the resource requried for a quantum agorithm to demonstrate quadratic or exponential speedup over a classical algorithm remains an open question. 
It was demonstrated in 1999 that for Quantum Communication tasks, the presence of entanglement is a necessary and sufficient condition for improvement over classical techniques~\cite{Raz1999}.
